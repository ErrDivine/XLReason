# Experiment-style Results

This directory hosts synthetic plots and tables that mimic the outcome of bilingual I-QGP experiments. Values are illustrative only and are generated by `results/generate_results.py`.

## Figures
- `score_comparison.png`: Side-by-side bars for English and Chinese exact-match accuracy across four systems (English-only fine-tune, Chinese-only fine-tune, bilingual baseline, and I-QGP). Use this to eyeball relative accuracy gains per language.
- `training_curve.png`: Line plot of training vs. development loss over optimization steps (x-axis expressed in thousands). Helps visualize convergence and overfitting trends.
- `ablation_impact.png`: Horizontal bars showing the overall score drop (Δ vs. full model) when removing key components such as EMD alignment, VQ planner, entity eraser, code-switch dropout (CSD), or QID anchoring.
- `code_switch_robustness.png`: Accuracy curves under 0–30% code-switch ratios for both languages, indicating robustness when steps swap languages during inference.
- `entity_agreement_heatmap.png`: Heatmap of agreement quality across task categories (Math, Commonsense, Science, QA), annotated with Jaccard scores to show how consistently entities align across languages.

## Tables
- `score_comparison.csv`: Aggregate metrics for each model, with columns `Model`, `EN EM`, `ZH EM`, `Bilingual Agreement`, `Graph F1`, and `Entity Jaccard` to summarize answer accuracy plus structural/entity quality.
- `ablations.csv`: Component removal study with columns `Ablation`, `EN EM`, `ZH EM`, `Agreement`, and `Δ Overall` (score delta relative to the full system).
- `code_switch_stress.csv`: Stress-test results by code-switch percentage, listing `Code-switch %`, `EN EM`, `ZH EM`, and `Bilingual Agreement` for each setting.
- `agreement_breakdown.csv`: Category-level alignment metrics (`Category`, `Entity Jaccard`, `Unit Match`, `Graph F1`) that underpin the heatmap.
- `training_stability.csv`: Seed-wise reproducibility table showing `Seed`, `EN EM`, `ZH EM`, `Agreement`, and `Graph F1` to gauge run-to-run variance.
