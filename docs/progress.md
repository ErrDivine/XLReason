# Implementation Progress Log

## Working Plan
1. Establish repository structure with core packages (`iqgp/`) and support modules.
2. Implement planner graph, vector quantization utilities, and planner module.
3. Create model stack (backbone, adapters, decoders) and loss components.
4. Add synthetic data utilities and training script for end-to-end demonstration.
5. Document work and build pytest suite covering planner, losses, and full reasoner.

## Current Session Plan
- Re-read `docs/plan.md` and audit the implemented modules to confirm they still mirror the intended bilingual reasoning pipeline.
- Add contributor-facing documentation that explains how to execute the experiment end-to-end with the current codebase.
- Verify the existing smoke tests and training script wiring to ensure no regressions were introduced since the last session.

## Progress Journal
- **Codebase audit:** Reviewed planner, objectives, data, and test modules to surface missing imports and structural gaps introduced in the previous revision.
- **Repository scaffolded:** Added package directories and module placeholders to mirror the blueprint from `docs/plan.md`.
- **Planner implemented:** Built `PlannerIQGP` with cross-attention fusion, query-based node proposal, vector quantization, pointer heads, and edge scorer producing `PlannerGraph` objects.
- **Model stack wired:** Created `BilingualReasoner` connecting shared transformer backbone, language adapters, planner, and decoders with dataclass outputs.
- **Objective suite:** Implemented Sinkhorn-based EMD alignment, InfoNCE plan contrast, entity/unit agreement, code-switch consistency, and language eraser utilities alongside a learnable lexicon projector and adversarial gradient reversal module.
- **Data & scripts:** Added synthetic dataset generator plus an illustrative training loop that exercises all components and loss terms on random data.
- **Testing:** Authored pytest cases validating planner output shapes, loss numerics, and forward propagation through the full reasoner stack.
- **Test harness fixes:** Normalized pytest modules to import torch via `pytest.importorskip`, restored missing dataclass imports, and ensured dataset helpers expose descriptive docstrings for future contributors.
- **Documentation manual:** Composed `docs/experiment_manual.md` describing environment setup, data preparation, training, evaluation, and troubleshooting workflows so others can reproduce and extend the experiment.
- **Implementation audit:** Reviewed planner, model, loss, data, and script modules against `docs/plan.md`, confirming interfaces, tensor shapes, and masking semantics remain aligned with the design.

```

## Testing Summary
- `pytest` exercises planner graph construction, loss behaviors, and full-stack reasoning under PyTorch; each test module
  guards its dependency with `pytest.importorskip("torch")` so missing runtimes surface as explicit skips rather than
  silent failures.

## Next Steps
- Integrate real datasets and entity/unit grounding modules.
- Extend evaluation scripts for metrics outlined in the original plan.
